# Key_Market_Crash_Indicators_And_Optimal_Portfolio
In this analysis we examine several key indicators typically associated with stock market crashes. In this assignment we assume the definition of a market crash as "an abrupt drop in stock prices, which may trigger a prolonged bear market or signal economic trouble ahead" (Investopedia). The scope of our examination will include four timeframes typically identified as a "crash": the dotcom bubble in the early 2000's, the real estate bubble of 2008, the Covid19 pandemic period, and the present market conditions. After examining these key indicators such as GDP, Unemployment, Industrial Productions, Inflation, and Fedfunds we will take a look at our current market to see if there are any commonalities that might indicate a coming recession or crash. For each period we will also be looking at what sectors perform well in the SP500 during these market crash conditions to attempt to indentify sectors that may be worth investing in during market crashes or bear markets.

## Technologies
You will need the following csv data for the project: Combined_Sectors_df which containes historical data for the 11 sectors of the SP500. This dataframe will be used for each different df. The following csv files are key indicator data which include: FEDFUNDS.csv, GDP2.csv, INDPRO.csv, inflation.csv, UNRATE.csv. MCForecastTools library must also be in your repository to run MonteCarlo Forecast.

## Conclusion
There isn't one sector in the S&P 500 that performs the best across the three market crashes we observed. As for leading indicators: a large decrease in GDP, increase in unemployment, and a increase in inflation rate are likely indicators of a stock market crash.
